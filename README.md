<b>Magic Mod for Quake 4</b>


This mod aims to add a spellcasting system into Quake 4, letting the player cast combinations of elemental magic to create unique spell effects. 
Currently, there are four elements that will be implemented: rock, fire, ice, and lightning. 
Different inputs of these elements will produce unique combination spells - for example, rock and fire could make a meteor-like effect.
This system is inspired by another game called Magicka.
There will be a mana system, magical themed pickups that give certain effects (buffs, restore mana, etc.).
To add some difficulty into the game, enemies and players will have resistances and weaknesses to different types of magic. Enemies will also deal elemental damage.
The player will be able to have different kinds of robes, armor, etc. to change their affinities.

-Replace weapons with elemental casting system (10 spells/effects that can be cast through the system)

-Add elemental affinities to monsters

-Magical themed pickups
